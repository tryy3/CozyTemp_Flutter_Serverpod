# App Icon/Logo

Place your logo PNG file here with the name `logo.png`.

## Requirements

- **Format:** PNG
- **Recommended size:** 1024x1024 pixels or larger

## After Adding Your Logo

Once you've placed your logo file here, run the following command to generate all platform-specific icons:

```bash
dart run flutter_launcher_icons
```

This will automatically generate:

- Linux application icons
- Web app icons

The generated icons will be placed in the appropriate platform directories.
